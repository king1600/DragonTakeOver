## Story
Long ago, there were dragons that lived with humans.
the humans haf giften powers and they helped the dragons survive as pets.
One "Nova" being from the being clan wanted a different world.
The Nova's name was Niel. The "Nova" clan that he belonged to was killed by a wild dragon.
After that, he sought to rid dragons from the world.
Niel kidnapps a bunch of pet dragons and the local towns go crazy.
He orders that only 1 child from each clan come and face him if they want the dragons back.
He then converts all the dragons in each town to monsters with a virus he was making since he was little.
The Village has to drive out the dragons and they send the best kids in their town to fight Neil.
The kids names were "Jack", "Crystal" and "Nathan". You get to play as one of them.
They go on a journey slaying infected dragons in different areas with different abilities.
They go through different dragon biomes: "Hell","Swamp",and "Snow". Each place has different dragons.
Each biome has a boss to defeat and when you defeat the boss, it drops it's perl.
You have to get all 3 perls to unlock the portal to the "Nova" village dimension.
Once you've done that, you face a small amount of Nova + (Hell, swamp or Snow) dragons.
After you beat those, then you have to face the ultimate boss.
Niel himself turns into a giant dragon. You have to work together to beat Neil.
After you beat him, you return to the village with all the dragons that were kidnapped.
And you have beaten the game.
